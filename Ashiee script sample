To follow the instructions provided, let's go step by step:
Step #1: Create the Main Directory 'Ashiee' then view using ls -1 command:
Copy the code:
mkdir Ashiee
ls -1

Step #2: Inside the Main Directory 'Ashiee', make another directory named 'SystemsAdministrationandMaintenance' then view using ls -1 command.
Copy the code:
cd Ashiee
mkdir SystemsAdministrationandMaintenance
ls -1

Step #3: Inside the 'SystemsAdministrationandMaintenance' create a txt file 'grades' using 'touch' command and view using 'ls -1' command.
Copy the code:
cd SystemsAdministrationandMaintenance
touch grades.txt
ls -l

Step #4: Set permission to the newly created txt file 'grades'
Copy the command:
cd ../..
chmod 755 Ashiee/SystemsAdministrationandMaintenance/grades.txt
ls -l

Step #5: Edit the 'grades.txt' using vi editor.
Copy the command:
vi Ashiee/SystemsAdministrationandMaintenance/grades.txt

Once you're in the vi editor, press i to enter the insert mode. Then copy and paste the following text into the file:
# This is my grades script
clear
echo "Ashie."
echo "I am 19 yrs old."
echo "My full name is John Ashley Africa Gallamoza."
echo "From BSIT-102A."
echo "My motto in life is Admiration is the purest form of love. To look at you is to witness the beauty of a soul that captivates my heart."
# ask the user for their grades
echo "Hello there, please input your grades as follows!"
read gradesm

echo "Here are your grades: $gradesm"

Note: You can modify the codes as follows, for better improvisation.

To save the changes and exit, press Esc to exit the insert mode, then type :wq and press Enter. Or, simply using SHIFT + : + x, to save the commands.

Step #6: Check for the permissions and run the script:
chmod +x Ashiee/SystemsAdministrationandMaintenance/grades.sh
cd Ashiee/SystemsAdministrationandMaintenance
bash grades.sh

Step #7: Install the 'tree' command to display the whole files and folders:
sudo apt install tree
tree
